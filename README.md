tweet volume over time -> tweet volume regarding both platforms follows a similar trend 

tweets by country -> only conclusion to draw is that theyre almost evenly popular acorss 
twitter users by country due to the bias we have introduced with filtering

posting frequency of playstation and xbox marketing accounts -> xbox begins to 
post much more heavily on the run up to release

sentiment scores for both playstation and xbox -> t-tested. xbox has a more positive overall sentiment than playstation
but both are positive.

games to be released by genre in the next 2 years -> identify gaps in the market on each platform

x ---------------------- SCENARIO: ---------------------- x 

We are a popular game development studio which is deciding on our next game. We need to decide on a genre of game and
a platform that the game is going to be released on. We have been offered exclusive deals by both microsoft and playstation,
but we also have the opportunity to develop multi-platform if we feel this is the bexst option.  

Which platform and genre of game are the best choice to begin work on? which platform in the new generation is going
to dominate and allow us to reach more customers? which platform gives us the opportunity to develop a memorable and
beloved game?
